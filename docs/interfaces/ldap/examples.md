# LDAP interface examples

:fontawesome-brands-github:
[KxSystems/ldap](https://github.com/KxSystems/ldap)

The scripts below are in the `examples` folder of the [interface](https://github.com/KxSystems/ldap/tree/master/examples). 
They provide insight into the different capabilities of the interface.

## Requirements

1. The LDAP interface installed as described in the interfaceâ€™s [`README.md`](https://github.com/kxsystems/ldap/blob/master/README.md)
2. The folder `q/` containing `ldap.q` placed either in the examples folder or (preferably) in the your `QHOME` directory.

## Root DSE Query

Queries the servers rootDSE. Depending on the functionality your server supports & config, it may show attributes such as supportedSASLMechanisms (supported security mechanisms for use in bind). Reference [here](https://ldapwiki.com/wiki/RootDSE) for details other attributes that may be populated. The rootDSE is often used to discover what functionality an LDAP server may support & information to identify the type of LDAP server (e.g. vendor details). The rootDSE can be subject to access restrictions, so your server may require you to do a specific bind to retrieve these details.

The connection details within the script may need altered to communicate with your LDAP server.

```bash
q root_dse.q
```

## Search

Created to show an example of an ldap search that works with the example LDAP server available from [https://github.com/rroemhild/docker-test-openldapi](https://github.com/rroemhild/docker-test-openldapi). Example searches provided in the script, such as searching for a users email. NOTE: this example server does not require a bind with user dn/password.

```bash
q search.q
```
